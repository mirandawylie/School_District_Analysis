# School District Analysis


## Overview
The annual school district analysis was compromised due to academic dishonesty of Thomas High School ninth graders. To uphold the state-testing standards, the school district data has been reconfigured to remove the math and reading scores for Thomas High School ninth graders. With these compromised results removed, the annual district analysis was able to determine the following:

* district summary
* school summary
* top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
* average math score for each grade level from each school
* average reading score for each grade level from each school
* scores by school spending per student, by school size, and by school type
