# School District Analysis


## Overview
Annual school district analysis was compromised due to academic dishonesty of Thomas High School ninth graders. To uphold the state-testing standards, the school district data has been reconfigured to remove the math and reading scores for Thomas High School ninth graders. With these compromised results removed, the annual district analysis was able to determine the following:

* District summary
* School summary
* Top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
* Average math score for each grade level from each school
* Average reading score for each grade level from each school
* Scores by school spending per student, by school size, and by school type

Sources: Python 3.7.9, Conda envs PythonData

## Results
Of the seven school district metrics (Total School Budget, Per Student Budget, Average Math Score, Average Reading Score, % Passing Math, % Passing Reading, % Overall Passing), only the reading and math data points were slightly affected by the changes in the data. 

* District summary
The district summary % overall passing went from 65.17% to 64.9%

* School summary
The school summary stays the same except for the results of Thomas High School. 

Initial results
Refactored results

* Top 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate


* Bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate

* Average math score for each grade level from each school

* Average reading score for each grade level from each school

* Scores by school spending per student, by school size, and by school type

How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
Even with the refactored results, Thomas High School still ranks second, however the overal passing percentage changed from 90.94% to 90.63%

How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
Math and reading scores by grade - The math and reading scores by grade stays the same except one will notice “nan” listed for Thomas 8th grade scores.
Scores by school spending - not affected
Scores by school size - not affected
Scores by school type - not affected
